                    My name is Shruti Sood. My date of birth is August 2<sup>nd</sup>,1999. I am from <strong>India</strong>. I did graduation in <em>"commerce"</em>. I liked accounting and finance but slowly I started realizing that I was not actually passionate about it. I always wanted to do a design program and thus, here I am, I decided to change my career and opted for this program because I believe "it's never too late to learn new things". I really like the below quote said by <em> <abbr title="Mahatma Gandhi">"Bapu"</abbr></em>.
                </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "Live as if you were to die tomorrow and learn as if you were to live forever". <cite> - "Mahatma Gandhi"</cite>
